Perspective Background
======================

An experiment to bring iOS7's home screen background to web. It uses the `deviceorientation` event to grab gyrometer information from your iOS WebView, than move the background to corresponding position.

Please use your iPhone in portrait mode for best results. This is a very preliminary experiment for now.
